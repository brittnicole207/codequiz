Id for Start game button has id of "startGame" but startGame() is looking for id 'start', not 'startGame' 
> Means startButton variable is undefined [Code is trying to access it's classList property which doesn't exist on an undefined value"]

updatetimer function doesn't accept parameters, but startGame I am trying to pass a variable as a parameter

Not properly closing updateQuestion() - close bracket, not close curly bracket
Trailing "," instead of ;" line 178
